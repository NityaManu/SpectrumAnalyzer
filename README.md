#**Real-Time Audio Spectrum Analyzer**

A Real-time Audio Spectrum Analyzer built in MATLAB. This .mlx file consists docmentation of all my learnings for building this from scratch.

#It includes:
1. Time-domain and frequency-domain representation of a given audio file.
2. Comparision of different windowing techniques on a given audio file.(hanning,hamming,rectangular,triangular,blackmann)
3. Implementation of live audio recording and spectrogram using loop
4. Comparision of spectrogram using for loop and spectrogram using built-in function.
5. Real-time audio recording and audio analysis.
